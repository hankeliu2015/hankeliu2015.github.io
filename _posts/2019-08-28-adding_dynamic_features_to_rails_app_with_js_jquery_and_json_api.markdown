This App’s new JS dynamic features were built based on my previous Rails ‘rental store’ App. Previously, the App features are to allow user set up login account, rent a tool base on the rental’s dates availability, keep tracking user’s rental record. The App’s models are User, Rental and Tool. Active Record relationships are: User has many Rentals, Tool has many Rentals and Rental belongs to Tool & User.
