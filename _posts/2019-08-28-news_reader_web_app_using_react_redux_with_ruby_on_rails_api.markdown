My News Reader App is helping users to access near real time news from official Hacker News APIs, add their comments, posting their own stories and share opinions with other users.

In the Application front end, I am using React/Redux to build the front end user interface. Both Redux store state and React state/props are used to manage data flow. In the backend, I have Ruby on Rails and SQLite database to persist data, 3 models are Comment, User and Post. Also, added Devise Gem to manage user login and account sign up.
