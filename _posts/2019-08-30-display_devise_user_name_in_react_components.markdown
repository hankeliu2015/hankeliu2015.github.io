In my News App built with Rails, Devise and React, I will need display login user’s user name on a few React Components. Current_user is a devise helper method, we can user it to render user’s data in Rails view files. But if we using React/Redux building front end, we will need to do some work on that to get user’s attributes rendered by React components. This article is about how to manage that by using Active Model Serializer and Rails API endpoint. Hope it will help you when working on similar tasks.
